# Welcome to Dr. Nipun Lab

We are a translational research group focused on understanding Alcohol associated liver Diseases (ALD), Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) and infections 
through **integrated multi-omics, causal inference, systems biology, and clinical proteomics**.

**Our primary focus areas include:**

- Multiomics (Proteomics, Transcriptomics, Genomics)  
- Multi-omics integration
- Trajectory analysis
- Causal inference  
- Microbial diversity & metaproteomics 
- Clinical prediction modeling  

Explore our **Members**, **Research**, **Publications**, and **Tools** using the top menu.
