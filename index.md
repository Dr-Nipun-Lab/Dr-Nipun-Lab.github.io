# Welcome to Dr. Nipun Lab

We are a translational research group focused on understanding liver diseases
through **integrated multi-omics, causal inference, systems biology, and clinical proteomics**.

**Our primary focus areas include:**

- Transcriptomics & Proteomics  
- Longitudinal multi-omics integration (TimeOmics, MEFISTO)  
- Causal inference (DoWhy, pgmpy, bnlearn, CausalML)  
- Microbial & metaproteomics  
- Clinical prediction modeling  

Explore our **Members**, **Research**, **Publications**, and **Tools** using the top menu.
