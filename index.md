# Welcome to Dr. Nipun Lab

We are a translational research group in the **Department of Hepatology at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh** focused on understanding Alcohol associated liver Diseases (ALD), Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) and infections 
through **Multi-omics, Bioinformatics, Systems biology, Clinical proteomics and Cognitive computing**.

**Our primary focus areas include:**

- Multiomics (Proteomics, Transcriptomics, Genomics)  
- Multi-omics integration
- Trajectory analysis
- Biomarker discovery pipeline and pathway analysis 
- Microbial diversity & metaproteomics analysis
- Molecular and experimental hepatology
- Clinical prediction modeling
- AI/ML
