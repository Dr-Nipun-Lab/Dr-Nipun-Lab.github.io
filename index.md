# Welcome to Dr. Nipun Lab

We are a translational research group focused on understanding liver diseases
through **integrated multi-omics, causal inference, systems biology, and clinical proteomics**.

Our work spans:

- Transcriptomics & Proteomics  
- Longitudinal multi-omics (TimeOmics, MEFISTO, PALMO)  
- Causal inference (DoWhy, CausalML, pgmpy, bnlearn)  
- Fungal & bacterial metaproteomics  
- Predictive modeling for mortality in acute liver conditions
