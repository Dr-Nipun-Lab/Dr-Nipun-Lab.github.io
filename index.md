# Welcome to Dr. Nipun Lab

We are a translational research group in the **Department of Hepatology at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh** focused on understanding Alcohol associated liver Diseases (ALD), Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) and infections 
through **Clinical trials, Clinical proteomics, Bioinformatics, Multi-omics, Systems biology, and Cognitive computing**.

**Our primary focus areas include:**
- Clinical trials in ALD
- clinical trajectory analysis
- Clinical prediction modeling
- Diagnostic and prognostic Biomarker discovery
- Multiomics (Proteomics, Transcriptomics, Genomics)  
- Multi-omics integration
- Microbial diversity & metaproteomics in liver diseases
- Molecular and experimental hepatology
- AI/ML pipelines and workflows
