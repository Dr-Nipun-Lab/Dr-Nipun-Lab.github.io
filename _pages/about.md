## About Dr. Nipun Lab

We are a systems biology and multi-omics research group focused on understanding liver diseases through:

- Multi-OMICS (Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics)
- Multi-omics integration
- Causal inference
- Microbial and metaproteomic profiling
- Biomarker discovery
- Machine learning and AI for clinical prediction

Our mission is to discover mechanistic drivers of acute hepatic decompensation,
ACLF progression, and mortality using **integrated omics and computational approaches**.
