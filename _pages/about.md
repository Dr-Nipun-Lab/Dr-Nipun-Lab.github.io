## About Dr. Nipun Lab

We are a systems biology and multi-omics research group focused on understanding
acute liver diseases through:

- Transcriptomics & Proteomics
- Longitudinal multi-omics integration
- Causal inference (DoWhy, bnlearn, Bayesian Networks)
- Microbial and metaproteomic profiling
- Biomarker discovery (MOLI, SHAP, MEFISTO, TimeOmics)
- Machine learning for clinical prediction

Our mission is to discover mechanistic drivers of acute hepatic decompensation,
ACLF progression, and mortality using **integrated omics and computational approaches**.
