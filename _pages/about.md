# About Dr. Nipun Lab

The **Dr. Nipun Lab** is a translational research group focused on decoding the biology of **acute hepatic decompensation, alcohol-associated liver diseases, and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)** through multi-omics and computational science.

We integrate **clinical proteomics, systems biology, microbial–host interaction profiling, and data-driven modeling** to uncover mechanisms that drive inflammation, immune dysfunction, organ failure, and mortality in critically ill patients.

Our work spans:
- Integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metaproteomic analyses  
- Bioinformatics and network-based modeling  
- Biomarker discovery and early risk prediction  
- Computational pipelines and machine learning for clinical translation  

Our mission is to transform biological complexity into **actionable insights** that advance diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making in severe liver disease.
